## [ Problem ]: Write a program to meet the following three requirements
### a) Design a 7-convolutional-layer architecture to classify Mnist dataset. (You may only use convolutional layers.)

### b) How to train the first 4 layer with learning rate 0.001 and the last 3 layer with learning rate 0.0001?

### c) Given a vairable input which has same shape as Mnist dataset, calculate the gradient of the input variable.

## [ Evaluation ]: 
### Debugging and executing correctly
